            <p>
              Jack Sutter is obsessed with making dreams into reality.
              His projects begin merely as conceptual ideas, and progress into one of a kind works.
              With his creative design process, Jack works one step at a time until the final product
              is aesthetically and functionally complete, with the highest industry standards.
              Creativity is just as important as craft in Jack's creations.  His work combines a
              variety of traditional and contemporary methods of craftsmanship to make Jack of All
              Trades originals.  He loves working with his clients to evolve ideas into fruition.
              Experienced in many trades, Jack works mostly with metal because of its strength,
              versatility, and natural beauty.<br /><br />

              <span class="block-quote">"I work with my hands and my mind.  I pursue beauty in what I produce. I see art in science and science in art."</span>
